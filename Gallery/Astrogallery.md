# The Astro Gallery

Welcome to my very own little astrophotography gallery! I wanted to find a fairly simple way to tell my astrophotography journey from the beginning. A simple way to put it together as well as share it to anybody interested in seeing what our corner of the cosmos has to offer.

I got my first DSLR camera in early 2020, a Canon EOS Rebel T7, but I did my very first attempts at capturing the night sky in the beginning of October 2023. I got the camera primarily for normal photography at first. I was aware that astrophotography was possible, but it felt complicated since I was living in the middle of a city and I didn't see myself driving at least 30 minutes away from home just to get a chance at practicing a hobby.

I recently rediscovered the astrophotography videos on Youtube from Nebula Photos, showing you how to get started with astrophotography using minimal gear. That was enough to motivate me to get my Canon out again and start taking pictures while I waited for my intervalometer to be delivered, the only thing I was missing to get started!

Below here are the results of my nights spent with the stars. rawr~

## 2023

### October

I was waiting for my intervalometer to get delivered, but still decided to get the camera and tripod out and get some images.

> The Moon and Jupiter on October 2nd

This image has close to no editing, I barely touched the contrast a little bit, cropped and called it a day.

After I got my intervalometer, it took a little while but I eventually managed to get some clear skies. Armed with my Canon Rebel T7, a tripod and my new intervalometer, I took my first lights...but unfortunately, I didn't do the focus properly, so I ended up with some nice donuts instead of stars. Homer Simpson would be so proud! :3

A few days later, got a weekend with some clear nights and this time I was ready and determined to make this work! I captured 3 different targets through the course of both nights, starting with the first target and moving to the next when the current target would get to an area of the sky that made it quite inconvenient to take pictures.

> The Andromeda galaxy captured on October 14 and 15 and edited on October 15

![The Andromeda Galaxy](./2023/2023-10-15%20M31%20Andromeda.png)

> 85mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/2 | 32 min exposure (2 sec per light)

This image of Andromeda is my very first attempt at capturing as well as editing data of a deep space object. The edit is very minimal, all I did was stretching the data histogram in Glimpse and voilÃ !

---

Once Andromeda got out of a comfortable capture position, I aimed my camera at a new target that was now visible from my vantage point: the Pleiades!

> 85mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/2 | 32 min exposure (2 sec per light)

This image is again a very minimal edit, a.k.a stretching the data in Glimpse.

Later in the night, I moved my setup to another spot in the backyard in order to have a good field of view on my third target: the Orion constellation, more specifically the lower half. The Orion constellation has a lot of stuff going on! Here is part of what you can find around those stars.

> 85mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/2 | 28 min exposure (2 sec per light)

Again, this is only a stretch of the stacked data. As you can see, I didn't know how to fix a background color gradient yet, so I tried to crop my image in a way that the gradient would be part of the composition somehow.

A bit later in the month, I learned about Siril and some of its editing capabilities. With that new knowledge, I decided to revisit my data of Andromeda, Pleiades and Orion that I collected earlier in the month...it would have been nice to collect more data, but clouds disagreed~ :3

With the use of Siril and Starnet++, I was able to push the editing of all that data much further. Here are the new edits!

During that time of cloudiness, amazed with the results I got so far, I decided to go ahead and purchase my first telescope along with a mount and tripod and other accessories so I can take this new hobby to the next level...and also not full all my computer storage in a few sessions cause I am stuck taking 2-second exposures! :3

So I got a nice astrograph refractor telescope from Askar, the 65PHQ (65mm aperture, 416mm focal length, F/6.4). Also got a nice Skywatcher Star Adventurer GTI to support that amazing scope. Coupled with a Canon 60D Full-Spectrum and a UV-IR block filter, I was ready for moar!! :3

Around Halloween, the clouds finally decided to let me peak at the sky a little bit, but a lot of the stars were nowhere to be seen! The full Moon in all its glory was illuminating the night and so I decided to aim my new fancy telescope at it!

On the night of Halloween, Jupiter gazed through the clouds a few times and I tried lucky imaging for the first time with the crop mode video on my Canon 60D. It took a little bit of time until I went ahead and got the softwares I need to process the data I collected...which brings us to...

### November

For this picture of Jupiter, I used lucky imaging, which is basically taking a video of the planet and then use a software to stack all the good frames of the video taken. I did a combination of two images for this one, as it's not possible to capture the moons and the details of Jupiter at the same time.

On the same day, I was able to get some imaging time again, so I decided to try out the go to function of my Skywatcher Star Adventurer GTI. I went for a new target this time, one that is close to the Cassiopeia constellation: The Pacman nebula!

> The Pacman nebula captured on November 8 and edited on November 9

> 416mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/6.4 | 5 min exposure (10 sec lights)

### December

The rest of november and most of december were quite uneventful...almost always cloudy at night, the only clear nights being cold AF...as in....-20C cold AF making it pretty impossible to do any imaging out in the open. And it's not for lack of trying...BUT! Finally, on the first night of my vacation...surprise! A completely clear night with a temperature of -10C with no wind. I had to give it a try!

And so I did. My rig was out the whole night and throughout the night, I captured 3 different targets, switching to the next target when the current one went out of sight.

The first target is a nebula I have taken before, but that was with a smol camera lens. Now, you can witness all those marvelous photons captured with my telescope after their amazing travel of around 1500 light years! The Orion nebula (the big one to the left) along with the running man nebula (smol one to the right). A cradle for baby stars!

> 416mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/6.4 | 1 hour 25 min exposure (15 sec lights)

---

The second target was captured during the same night, once Orion wasn't visible anymore. I gathered very little data on it and so was very hard to process in a way to achieve a satisfactory result...

## 2024

The first part of 2024 was pretty uneventful, I managed to image one night before one amazing event: the total eclipse!
