I got my first DSLR camera in early 2020, a Canon EOS Rebel T7, but I did my very first attempts at capturing the night sky in the beginning of October 2023. Below here are the results of my nights spent with the stars. Rawr~

## 2023

I was waiting for my intervalometer to get delivered, but still decided to get the camera and tripod out and get some images.

> The Moon and Jupiter on October 2nd

> 55mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/5.6 | 1sec exposure

This image has close to no editing, I barely touched the contrast a little bit, cropped and called it a day.

After I got my intervalometer, it took a little while but I eventually managed to get some clear skies. Armed with my Canon Rebel T7, a tripod and my new intervalometer, I took my first lights...but unfortunately, I didn't do the focus properly, so I ended up with some nice donuts instead of stars. Homer Simpson would be so proud! :3

A few days later, got a weekend with some clear nights and this time I was ready and determined to make this work! I captured 3 different targets through the course of both nights, starting with the first target and moving to the next when the current target would get to an area of the sky that made it quite inconvenient to take pictures.

> The Andromeda galaxy captured on October 14 and 15 and edited on October 15

![The Andromeda Galaxy](./2023/2023-10-15%20M31%20Andromeda.png)

> 85mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/2 | 32min exposure (2sec per light)

This image of Andromeda is my very first attempt at capturing as well as editing data of a deep space object. The edit is very minimal, all I did was stretching the data histogram in Glimpse and voilÃ !

Once Andromeda got out of a comfortable capture position, I aimed my camera at a new target that was now visible from my vantage point: the Pleiades!

> The Pleiades star cluster captured on October 14 and 15 and edited on October 16

> 85mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/2 | 32min exposure (2sec per light)

This image is again a very minimal edit, a.k.a stretching the data in Glimpse.

Later in the night, I moved my setup to another spot in the backyard in order to have a good field of view on my third target: the Orion constellation, more specifically the lower half. The Orion constellation has a lot of stuff going on! Here is part of what you can find around those stars.

> The Orion and Running Man nebulae (bottom right) along with the Flame and Horsehead nebulae (top left) captured on October 14 and 15 and edited on October 16

![The Orion, Running Man, Flame and Horsehead nebulae](./2023/2023-10-16%20M42%20Orion.png)

> 85mm focal length | 1600 ISO | F/2 | 28min exposure (2sec per light)

Again, this is only a stretch of the stacked data. As you can see, I didn't know how to fix a background color gradient yet, so I tried to crop my image in a way that the gradient would be part of the composition somehow.
