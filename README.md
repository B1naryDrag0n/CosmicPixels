Welcome to my astrophotography journey! :3

I started this hobby in October of 2023 after spending the couple previous months playing space themed video games. Playing these games really reignited my passion for astronomy, a passion I've had since I was a kid. I thought about getting a telescope many years ago, but soon after I moved to a big city and so I didn't feel like it would be a good purchase for the time being. Now that I am back under Bortle 4 skies, I decided to go ahead and get my first telescope after discovering astrophotography!

This repository is meant to be a little gallery of my journey through the stars. It has two main sections:

- [**The Astro Gallery**](./2_Astrogallery.md) : my final edits
- [**The Astro Stack Library**](./3_Astrostack.md) : stacked images used for the edits in the gallery

Hope you enjoy! :3
